# CovidStatisticsProject

This is the Covid Statistics project. 

This application implements some query type services about 
an online source of covid world wide data. The application 
can download the source locally and use it that way. It 
calculates and prints the country with the most confirmed 
cases, it can count the number of records a country has 
within the source file, it can print a list of countries 
with their respective max number of confirmed, recovered 
or death cases and it also calculates the average deaths 
per country.
